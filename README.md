Project Purpose: Clickable Phone Numbers for Quick Messaging on Telegram
This project detects phone numbers in text or on a webpage and makes them clickable. When clicked, users are directed to the corresponding Telegram profile or chat, enabling faster communication.

The goal is to simplify the process of connecting with people on Telegram by automating the detection and interaction with phone numbers. Whether for personal or professional use, this project streamlines messaging workflows.

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements to make it even better!
